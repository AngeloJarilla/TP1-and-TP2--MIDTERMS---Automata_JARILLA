# TP1-and-TP2--MIDTERMS---Automata_JARILLA
This is my submission for TP1 and TP2 for the subject Theory of Computations with Automata

Algorithm Design Case Study & Regex Automata Demo
Project Overview

This repository contains two main parts:

PT1: Case Study
A formal case study comparing Yamada vs Thompson on the McNaughton Algorithm, highlighting their contributions and key takeaways in algorithm design.

PT2: Python Regex with Finite Automata
A working Python script using regular expressions and finite automata (DFA/NFA concepts). The program takes a regex pattern and test strings as arguments, then checks if they match. (For PT2, I have uploaded the video demonstration via GDRIVE, in which you can see the link below.)
